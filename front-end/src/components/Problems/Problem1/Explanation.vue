      <p>  The naive way to solve it is for every element in the second array,
      check whether it appears in the first array. Note that there may be duplicate
      elements in the arrays so we should pay special attention to it. The complexity
      of this approach is O(N^2). A more efficient solution is to sort the first array,
      so while checking whether an element in the first array appears in the second,
      we can do binary search. But we should still be careful about duplicate elements.
      The complexity is O(NlogN). If we don’t want to deal with the special case of duplicate
      numbers, we can sort both arrays and iterate over them simultaneously. Once two iterators
      have different values we can stop. The value of the first iterator is the missing element.
      This solution is also O(NlogN). Here is the algorithm for this approach:</p>

      <p>Let’s see whether we can do better. In most interviews, we would be expected to come up with
      a linear time solution. We can use a hashtable and store the number of times each element appears
      in the second array. Then for each element in the first array we decrement its counter. Once hit
      an element with zero count that’s the missing element. Here is the algorithm: </p>
      <img src="/images/problem1-description/2.png" width=50% />
      The time complexity is optimal O(N) but the space complexity is also O(N), because of the hashtable.
      Ideally we would like to have constant space complexity. One possible solution is computing the sum
      of all the numbers in array1 and array2, and subtracting array2’s sum from array1’s sum. The
      difference is the missing number in array2. However, this approach is somewhat problematic.
      What if the arrays are too long, or the numbers are very large. Then overflow will occur while
      summing up the numbers.<p>
      <br>
      <p>By performing a very clever trick, we can achieve linear time and constant space complexity
      without any problems. Here it is: initialize a variable to 0, then XOR every element in the first
      and second arrays with that variable. In the end, the value of the variable is the result, missing
      element in array2. Classy, isn’t it? Here is the code:</p>
      <img src="/images/problem1-description/3.png" width=50% />

      <p>Let’s analyze why this approach works. What happens when we XOR two numbers? We should think
      bitwise, instead of decimal. XORing a 4-bit number with 1011 would flip the first, third, and
      fourth bits of the number. XORing the result again with 1011 would flip those bits back to their
      original value. So, if we XOR a number two times with some number nothing will change. We can
      also XOR with multiple numbers and the order would not matter. For example, say we XOR the number
      n1 with n2, then XOR the result with n3, then XOR their result with n2, and then with n3. The final
      result would be the original number n1. Because every XOR operation flips some bits and when we XOR
      with the same number again, we flip those bits back. So the order of XOR operations is not important.
      If we XOR a number with some number an odd number of times, there will be no effect.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Above we XOR all the numbers in array1 and array2. All numbers in array2 also appear in array1,
      but there is an extra number in array1. So the effect of each XOR from array2 is being reset by the
      corresponding same number in array1 (remember that the order of XOR is not important). But we can’t
      reset the XOR of the extra number in array1, because it doesn’t appear in array2. So the result is as
      if we XOR 0 with that extra number, which is the number itself. Since XOR of a number with 0 is the
      number. Therefore, in the end we get the missing number in array2. The space complexity of this solution
      is constant O(1) since we only use one extra variable. Time complexity is O(N) because we perform a single
      pass from the arrays.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This question demonstrates the power of bitwise operations, and how to use them effectively to achieve
      optimal solutions. It’s one of my favorite interview questions.</p>
